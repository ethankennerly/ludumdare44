1. First level is really hard to tap on an s9. Took a while to register.
1. THE/H? Confused here. Ah i had to get multiple words.
1. Starts to really flow after I understood it but I feel its spending too long on max 3 letter words.
1. "Hen" is not registered as a word on this level (when). "Lay" is rejected here (play). I guess thats part of the game.  I just expected that it would accept any real word that was the correct length
1. I think the crossword itself could be bigger?
1. Also kinda minor but the ye olde text is kinda hard to read.  I do think that font adds some slight confusion, takes just a bit longer to visually parse it.
1. Minor but sometimes the next level button just spins when tapped. Second tap works though.
1. Minor but back button is weird. Expected ok button at the bottom or no button and just tap to dismiss.
1. UI elements are really low res. Minor again.
