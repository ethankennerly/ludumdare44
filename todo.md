# TODO

1. Satisfy [Jerome's comments](playtest.md#jerome-byrne):
    1. Also kinda minor but the ye olde text is kinda hard to read.  I do think that font adds some slight confusion, takes just a bit longer to visually parse it.
    1. Minor but sometimes the next level button just spins when tapped. Second tap works though.
